## Outline

The main aim of this project was to expand on previous knowledge around HTML & SCSS/CSS whilst also building upon newly aquired knowledge in Javascript. This project involved creating a Morse Code Translator from scratch and designing the front-end for it with no reference images provided. This project required the front-end to be scalable, responsive and useable on a variety of devices/viewports.

### Features

## MVP

The main requirements for this project were:

- Create a user interface that allows the user to either input some English text or some Morse Code.
- Create JS functions that would allow the user to:

  - Translate their English text into Morse Code.
  - Translate their Morse Code into English text.

- Make sure to handle spaces properly (ie. there is 1 space between English words, but one space between Morse Code characters).
- Must have at least two test suites i.e (two describe blocks).

## Summary

## Tech Stack
